# This is kind of terrible. We've got a package in WoW that
# generates our portfolio graphs, but it's not really made
# for distribution right now (e.g. it has no `setup.py` or
# formal list of dependencies). So here we're just "hacking"
# it into our Python installation and manually installing its
# dependencies, at least until we formally turn it into a
# real Python package.
